1.All of the weights for the CNN can be downloaded here, and there are nine soil weight models in total, each including the parameters of the model and the entire model structure. The structure of the model is provided in the code, so you only need to download number_model_epoch_350.pth to run the code. Here is a link to download the model: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1FJvOoacjFSfX1998VGInOg Extract Password: wx8j
2.Regarding the dataset, we eliminated missing data points while keeping only the data used to train the model. If you need the full dataset, you can get it by visiting the official website via the link in the paper. Here are the datasets used in the experiments for download. https://pan.baidu.com/s/1ONRBRJP9pRSfC2z_-sdoag Extract Password: eaxf
3.Regarding the code section, there exists a total of two sections of code. The first part of the code is used to train the neural network, with this code you can train your own neural network and save the weights of the model. This code will be uploaded to the OpenSA folder. The second part of the code uses interpretable methods to extract information from the saved model parameter files and apply it, this part of the code can be found in the IMSM.ipynb file.
